# Medium: Java Activity

## Overview
This repository comprises the Java activity designed to be used in tandem with
the VCDEP system, which you can find <a target="_blank"
href="https://github.com/vcdep/vcdep_setup">here</a>. This Java project is a portable
Music managing and playing software. We
have included a baseline project complete with test cases for Unit and
Integration Testing. This style of project is very useful as a teaching tool
since changes are very visual since students are able to see the change on
their own computer.
